The quality of the backward system - which is trained on the available parallel data and used for the back-translation - has been shown in many studies to affect the performance of the final NMT model. In low resource conditions, the available parallel data is usually not enough to train a backward model that can produce the qualitative synthetic data needed to train a standard translation model. This work proposes a self-training strategy where the output of the backward model is used to improve the model itself through the forward translation technique. The technique was shown to improve baseline low resource IWSLT'14 English-German and IWSLT'15 English-Vietnamese backward translation models by 11.06 and 1.5 BLEUs respectively. The synthetic data generated by the improved English-German backward model was used to train a forward model which out-performed another forward model trained using standard back-translation by 2.7 BLEU.","tags":null,"title":"Using Self-Training to Improve Back-Translation in Low Resource Neural Machine Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wilhelmina Nekoto","Vukosi Marivate","Tshinondiwa Matsila","Timi Fasubaa","Tajudeen Kolawole","Taiwo Fagbohungbe","Solomon Oluwole Akinola","Shamsuddee Hassan Muhammad","Salomon Kabongo","Salomey Osei"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"fc22c21a252c0b9895808777f9450f4f","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/nekoto-2020-participatory/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T15:53:24.936538Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nekoto-2020-participatory/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Participatory Research for Low-resourced Machine Translation: A Case Study in African Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Idris Abdulmumin","Bashir Shehu Galadanci","Aliyu Garba"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"8733e086181392f23633b4c2f8606251","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/abdulmumin-2019-ab/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T05:03:22.911082Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abdulmumin-2019-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"An effective method to generate a large number of parallel sentences for training improved neural machine translation (NMT) systems is the use of back-translations of the target-side monolingual data. The method was not able to utilize the available huge amount of monolingual data because of the inability of models to differentiate between the authentic and synthetic parallel data. Tagging, or using gates, has been used to enable translation models to distinguish between synthetic and authentic data, improving standard back-translation and also enabling the use of iterative back-translation on language pairs that under-performed using standard back-translation. This work presents pre-training and fine-tuning as a simplified but more effective approach of differentiating between the two data. The approach - tag-less back-translation - trains the model on the synthetic data and fine-tunes it on the authentic data. Experiments have shown the approach to outperform the baseline and standard back-translation by 4.0 and 0.7 BLEU respectively on low resource English-Vietnamese NMT. While the need for tagging (noising) the dataset has been removed, the technique outperformed tagged back-translation by 0.4 BLEU. The approach reached the best scores in less training time than the standard and tagged back-translation approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Tag-less Back-Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Idris Abdulmumin","Bashir Shehu Galadanci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"f12c75e495862494292eed37cbb5f7b5","permalink":"https://hausanlp.github.io/publication/abdulmumin-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2020-11-07T05:03:22.913105Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abdulmumin-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Words embedding (distributed word vector representations) have become an essential component of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, word analogy, named entity recognition and word similarity.

This work presents words embedding models using Word2Vec's Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) and Skip Gram (SG) models. The models, hauWE (Hausa Words Embedding), are bigger and better than the only previous model, making them more useful in NLP tasks. To compare the models, they were used to predict the 10 most similar words to 30 randomly selected Hausa words. hauWE CBoW's 88.7% and hauWE SG's 79.3% prediction accuracy greatly outperformed Bojanowski et al.
